-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
 Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other
 For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: Name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: Name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: Explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 
3. Identify the origin of entities, extract the following information:
- origin_identifier: The identifier of the origin of the extracted entities
 * For chat messages, the identifier is the timestamp of each message
 * For files, like publications, the identifier is the URI
- origin_type: The type of the origin, can be MESSAGE, FILE
 Format each origin as ("origin"{tuple_delimiter}<origin_identifier>{tuple_delimiter}<souce_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name> ...)

4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities, relationships, origins identified in steps 1, 2, and 3. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter
 
5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Special Requirements and Explanation-
1. The first line of each document specifies the type of the document

2. For chat messages, don't extract the timestamps as an entity
 For each relationship extracted from the chat messages, add the timestamp at the end of the relationship description
 For files and links in the messages, extract the DOI (or URI) as the title

Title: Webstrates: Shareable Dynamic Media
DOI: 10.1145/2807442.2807446
Authors: Clemens N. Klokmose, James R. Eagan, Siemen Baader, Wendy Mackay, Michel Beaudouin-Lafon
Abstract: We revisit Alan Kay's early vision of dynamic media that blurs the distinction between documents and applications. We introduce shareable dynamic media that are malleable by users, who may appropriate them in idiosyncratic ways; shareable among users, who collaborate on multiple aspects of the media; and distributable across diverse devices and platforms. We present Webstrates, an environment for exploring shareable dynamic media. Webstrates augment web technology with real-time sharing. They turn web pages into substrates, i.e. software entities that act as applications or documents depending upon use. We illustrate Webstrates with two implemented case studies: users collaboratively author an article with functionally and visually different editors that they can personalize and extend at run-time; and they orchestrate its presentation and audience participation with multiple devices. We demonstrate the simplicity and generative power of Webstrates with three additional prototypes and evaluate it from a systems perspective.
